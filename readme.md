# README

The reach firmware project is provided by the team at i3 Product Development to serve as the basis of an IoT device enabled with Cygnus Reach support.  It was initially developed on a Silicon Labs Thunderboard.

### What is this repository for?

* This project can be rebuilt to run on the Silicon Labs "Thunderboard" to demonstrate the integration of the Cygnus Reach functionality.
* This project can easily be forked and ported to meet the specific needs of a project that is using the Reach functionality.  
* The code is designed to port easily to other BLE enabled systems.

### How do I get set up?

* The "docs" folder contains a "Getting Started" document that explains how to run the demo and then how to rebuild the demo.
* The docs folder also contains more detailed information.
* Clone or fork this project.
* Install and use Silicon Labs' Simplicity Studio.  This project is built with version 5.3 and gecko 4.3.2.
* Create an SoC empty project and populate it with the subdirectories here.  
* To run on a non-SiLabs board ignore the silabs directory and connect to BLE as necessary.
